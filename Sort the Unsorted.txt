Question:
You are given an unsorted array of integers. Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and print the sorted array.

Input Format

First line contains an integer n — the number of elements in the array.
Second line contains n space-separated integers — the elements of the array.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
-10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
Output Format

Print the sorted array in non-decreasing order, with each element separated by a space.
Sample Input 0

5
3 1 4 2 5
Sample Output 0

1 2 3 4 5

Solution:

n=int(input())
unsorted_list=list(map(int,input().split()))
unsorted_list.sort()
for i in unsorted_list:
    print(i,end=' ')
